The Enhanced Embedded Tree Library is a lightweight and efficient implementation of balanced binary search trees designed specifically for embedded systems. This library provides implementations of popular tree data structures such as Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and Splay trees. Key features include embedded node structures to minimize memory overhead, optimized node size using unused pointer bits, and support for efficient tree traversal in both directions. The library offers a simple yet powerful API for managing dynamic data sets in resource-constrained environments.
